`Smart Folder Organizer` is a desktop utility designed to automatically tidy up any directory. It intelligently sorts files (like images, documents, and archives) into categorized subfolders based on customizable rules.

Stop wasting time manually cleaning your "Downloads" or "Projects" folderâ€”this tool does it for you with one click, while **respecting and preserving your original folder structure.**

## Key Features

* ** Intuitive GUI:** A clean and simple graphical interface built with Python's native Tkinter library.
* ** Cross-Platform:** Packaged to run as a standalone native app on both **Windows (`.exe`)** and **macOS (`.app`)**.
* ** Structure-Preserving Logic:** When organizing recursively, it creates category folders *inside* each subfolder (e.g., `Project/Notes/Images/`), keeping your original structure intact.
* ** Fully Customizable:** Easily edit the `config.json` file to add new file types or create your own categories (e.g., "Ebooks", "Fonts").
* ** One-Click Config:** A built-in **"Open Config Folder"** button instantly opens the correct system folder for you to edit the `config.json` file.
* ** Recursive Organizing:** Optionally clean up files in all subfolders, not just the top level.
* ** Activity Logging:** A real-time log in the app shows you exactly what's being moved, and a persistent `organizer.log` file is saved for troubleshooting.

## Tech Stack

* **Python 3**
* **Tkinter** (for the GUI)
* **PyInstaller** (for packaging into `.exe` and `.app`)
* **Standard Libraries:** `os`, `shutil`, `json`, `logging`, `platform`, `subprocess`
